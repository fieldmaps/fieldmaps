    <h1 className="has-text-centered">About me</h1>
    <p>
      I've been fascinated with putting maps on the internet since first doing
      this at university, which has led me to some wonderful and remote corners
      of the world. In the private sector, working with SparkGeo Consulting in
      northern Canada on web app development and geospatial analytics. In the
      humanitarian sector, with REACH Initiative on missions in Jordan, South
      Sudan, and Nigeria. In these field missions, I started getting involved
      with information management in multiple clusters and working groups. In
      particular, creating common operational datasets with OCHA had me realize
      how valuable this kind of core infrastructure is by the people who rely on
      them. Currently with the World Food Programme, I'm contributing to this
      project in my personal time as a way to continue collaboration with all
      the people I've been in touch with in the past.
