  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I've been fascinated with putting maps on the internet since first doing
    this at McGill University, which has led me to some wonderful and remote
    corners of the world. In the private sector, working with SparkGeo
    Consulting in Northern British Columbia on web app development and
    geospatial analytics. In the humanitarian sector, with REACH Initiative on
    missions in Jordan, South Sudan, and Nigeria. In these field missions, I
    started getting involved with information management in multiple clusters
    and working groups. In particular, creating common operational datasets with
    OCHA is what got me to start this site. Currently with the World Food
    Programme, I'm keeping this project active as a way to continue
    collaboration with all the people I've been in touch with in the past.
