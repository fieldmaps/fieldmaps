  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I've been fascinated with putting maps on the internet since going to McGill
    University, where I learned you could do this as a job. This led me to some
    wonderfully remote corners of the world. Starting in Northern British
    Columbia, Sparkgeo Consulting took me in to innovative amongst giants in
    Silicon Valley. In 2016, I decided to leave the private sector to gain
    humanitarian field experience with REACH Initiative, taking me on missions
    in Jordan, South Sudan, and Nigeria. There I started getting involved with
    information management working groups, and the experience of creating
    reference datasets for responses in those countries is what lead to starting
    this site. Currently working with the World Food Programme, I'm keeping this
    project active as a way to continue collaboration with the organizations
    I've been in touch with in the past.
